# Inline Styles

Html style attribute - inline styles with <style> tag are scoped declarations which override any declarations applied 
from your stylesheet. They have no selector because they are applied directly to the element they target. Adding
important! In your stylesheet you will be able to override the inline stylesheet but if inline has important! Than 
nothing can **override** them.
  
# Selectors

- CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
- Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
- Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
- IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. 
- Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
- Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
- Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
