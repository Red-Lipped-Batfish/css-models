# CSS Visual Guide

- CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.
- The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.
- font-size controls the size of text displayed.
- **font-weight** defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
- The **text-align** property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
- Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.
- CSS can make an element transparent with the **opacity** property.
- CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the **background-image** property.

# Display and Positioning

Using **display**(change how elements organize themselves) and **position**(to change how page organizes elements) css properties to improve the layout of the  site.

Special Notes

**Fixed elements** are displayed as part of the window and not part of the layout so layout will not know anything about
it. Because of this we need to do the following:

1. Shift the layout 
2. Set larger width since it will not resize automatically like the rest of the layout. 
3. Decide which image shows up on top using z-index.
4. Set bottom if fixed item is on the bottom. If item is first item on the top, it will not need any adjustments.

**inline-block**, is a hybrid display type for displaying elements horizontally and allows width/height to be set.
When setting the menu display, pls note it will not change to horizontal because the width of each element takes up **all the space**. Change the width/height.
